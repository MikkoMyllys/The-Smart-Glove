# The-Smart-Glove
Home-made intelligent glove

WORK IN PROGRESS!

The idea of this home-made project is to try to add some different technological features to a normal glove.
I'm using Arduino Nano as the board for this project. For now i have added an OLED screen, heartbeat sensor and a keypad
to the whole setup. Keypad is used to control the visual UI on the OLED screen with what you can choose between different
features. The heartbeat sensor has been sewed into the down side of the index finger on the glove. It's not 100% of the time
accurate due to the cheap price of the sensor, but it's giving data accurate enough when you are holding your hand still in the
glove.

Some features that for sure will be still added:
- Air temperature and humidity sensor
- Led(s) sewed into practical parts of the glove to get light when needed (snapping fingers could be
even the switch? pretty cool huh?)
- Nice and simple UI and lots of bugfixing

You never know if i would add even more features but those are the main objectives for now.
